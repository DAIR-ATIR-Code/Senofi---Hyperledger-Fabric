## Running the test network

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up a simple Fabric test network. The test network has three peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy chaincode.

Before you can deploy the test network, you need to install HLF tools and binaries. Go to the root folder and run ./scripts/install-bins.sh
